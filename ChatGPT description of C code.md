This code consists of two main functions related to calculating activity based on acceleration data:

1. **`CAD_get_activity_by_average_maximum_difference`**:
   - Computes an activity value based on the average of maximum differences from a filter.
   - Resets the filter values once the activity value is computed.

2. **`CAD_calculate_activity_by_current_difference`**:
   - Compares current acceleration values to previous values for three axes (X, Y, Z).
   - Applies noise filtering to remove insignificant changes.
   - Stores filtered activity values in a FIFO buffer (`filter_maximum_difference_sum`), which is later used by `CAD_get_activity_by_average_maximum_difference`.

### Explanation of Key Concepts

#### **1. `CAD_get_activity_by_average_maximum_difference`**
This function calculates an activity metric as follows:

- **Step 1: Initialize variables**  
  - `average_for_sqrt`: Stores the average value for square root calculation.
  - `sum_average_difference`: Accumulates the total sum of differences in the filter buffer.
  - `average_maximum_difference`: Stores the final calculated activity value.

- **Step 2: Iterate through the filter buffer**  
  - Loops through `filter_maximum_difference_sum` up to `counter_fifo_reading`.
  - Accumulates the differences into `sum_average_difference`.
  - Resets each element in `filter_maximum_difference_sum` to zero.
  - Stops the loop early if the maximum index (`FILTER_SIZE - 1`) is reached.

- **Step 3: Compute average and take square root**  
  - If `counter_fifo_reading` > 0, calculate the average.
  - Clamp the average value to 16 bits (`0xFFFF`) for safety.
  - Compute the square root of the average using a function `floorSqrt`.

- **Step 4: Reset filter and handle minimum value**  
  - Calls `CAD_reset_table()` to reset the filter and FIFO counter.
  - Ensures the activity value is at least 1 (required for server updates).

- **Step 5: Return the activity value**  
  - Returns the computed activity as an 8-bit integer.

#### **2. `CAD_calculate_activity_by_current_difference`**
This function populates the FIFO buffer used in the first function:

- **Step 1: Initialize variables**  
  - `difference[]`: Stores differences for X, Y, Z axes.
  - `maximum_axis_activity`: Tracks the sum of significant axis differences.

- **Step 2: Check previous data availability**  
  - Ensures previous acceleration values are valid (non-zero).

- **Step 3: Calculate differences**  
  - Computes absolute differences between current and previous acceleration values for each axis.
  - Filters out small differences below `AXIS_NOISE_FILTER_LIMIT_CURRENT` (removes noise).

- **Step 4: Aggregate activity**  
  - Sums up the filtered differences to compute `maximum_axis_activity`.

- **Step 5: Update the filter buffer**  
  - Stores `maximum_axis_activity` in `filter_maximum_difference_sum` at the current position (`pointer_filter`).
  - Wraps `pointer_filter` within the range of `FILTER_SIZE` using bitwise AND.

- **Step 6: Update previous values**  
  - Sets current acceleration values as previous for the next comparison.

- **Step 7: Increment FIFO counter**  
  - Updates `counter_fifo_reading` to track how many values have been added.

### Key Variables
- **`filter_maximum_difference_sum[]`**: A circular buffer storing the maximum differences of activity over time.
- **`counter_fifo_reading`**: Tracks how many entries are in the filter buffer.
- **`pointer_filter`**: Points to the next position in the buffer for storing new activity data.
- **`AXIS_NOISE_FILTER_LIMIT_CURRENT`**: A threshold to filter out noise from acceleration data.

### Interplay Between the Functions
1. `CAD_calculate_activity_by_current_difference` fills the FIFO buffer (`filter_maximum_difference_sum`) with filtered activity data.
2. `CAD_get_activity_by_average_maximum_difference` computes an activity value based on the average of these differences, applies a square root transformation, and resets the filter.
